MiniKanren with constraints in Java

## Introduction

_Logish_ is a Java 8+ implementation of
[**miniKanren**](http://minikanren.org/), an embedded domain-specific
language for logic programming. The project aims at emulating the key
benefits of fully-fledged
[**Prolog**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)-based constraint
logic programming systems in a Java-only environment at an acceptable
performance, and hence the name.

## Features

  - _Logish_ is small and compact: the core system is in a single Java
    source file `Logish.java`, and the finite domain constraint solver
    resides in another file `Fd.java`.
  
  - The usage is simple: for basic use it suffices to import static
    member `Logish.run`, and all static members of `Logish.Goal`.
  
  - _Logish_ internally uses [Java Vavr library](https://www.vavr.io/)
    for immutable functional data structures in Java.  A query result
    is a `Stream` of objects (no need to specify upfront how many
    solutions to look for).
    
  - Constraint solving over finite (integer) domains with linear
    constraints.
    
  - _Logish_ implements attributed variables, allowing multiple
    constraint solvers at the same time. The same mechanism is used by
    `freeze` and the finite domain solver.
    
  
## Basic use

```java
import static org.cellx.logish.Logish.run;
import static org.cellx.logish.Logish.Goal.*;
import io.vavr.collection.Stream;

public class MinimalLogish {

 public static void main(String[] argv) {
   final Stream<Object> result = run(q -> unify(q, "World"));
   for (final Object o: result) {
     System.out.println("Hello, " + o + "!");
   }
 }
}
```

In this example, method `run()` runs a query over a logical variable
named `q`, and returns a stream of values of `q` generated by a
logical goal to the left of `->`.  Here, the goal is `unify(q,
"World")`, which unifies (tries to establish logical equality between)
its arguments.  The logical reading of `run(q -> unify(q, "World")`
is: \`_Is there some q such that q is equal to the string literal
`"World"`?_'  The obvious solution is for the initially unknown
variable `q` to become equal to string literal `"World"`.  This is the
only solution for `q`, and the resulting `Stream` has exactly one
member. Therefore, the program prints `"Hello, World!"`.
